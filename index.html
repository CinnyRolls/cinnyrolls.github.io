          <h5>Who are we?</h5>
          <p>It is common to team up with acquaintances in the same class and it is exactly what
happened in our case. We are classmates but also and foremost a subgroup of friends
from a bigger group, which made us naturally team up together. We know we get along
well enough since we spend most of our time with each other at school, so we will
take advantage of that and make use of the fact that our team is made up of unique
people with different backgrounds to try and appeal to a larger audience.<br/>
<br/>
As an anecdote, our team name, "CinnyRolls", is a reference to cinnamon rolls, which
is a really great snack by the way. Why we chose it however, will remain a big secret
as it comes from a private joke...</p>

              <p>I've always been fascinated by computers and the way programs are made, how they
can magically work without any human pulling the strings behind, at least in appearance.
I have very little experience in computer programming, and I didn't really understand
anything before this year. I have tried, though, to make a FPS using openclassrooms
with a friend (who is now in Epitech). We tried doing it but it just ended up being
us copy pasting code. I also helped someone make a World of Warcraft private server
(told you, yarrrr) but I never really had the opportunity to claim it as my own
work. Therefore, having the opportunity to make a game ourselves is a challenge.
It is not going to be easy, but I am ready to take upon this challenge and prove
my worth inside this group. I have always been a fan of video games, which makes
it even harder to make one since I am even more demanding in terms of quality, but
on the other hand it makes me even more happy to make it.</p>

              <p>Like most of people at EPITA, I think, I like to play video games, and this since
I was really young. Although, I never got interested in programming until last year,
when I started the ISN courses in high school. Before this, I was seeing computer
engineering as something cool but I never ever thought about making it my academic
carrier. In ISN, I learned the basics of programming in Java and I made a game with
a friend (who is also in the school by the way) and I liked it a lot. So when I
had to choose a school for higher studies, I looked up some computer engineering
schools and here I am. I'm really looking forward to make this game because we have
a lot more resources than last year and we can do something great, I BELIEVE IN
MY TEAM!</p>

              <p>I remember back when I was young, I used to love to just operate our family’s computer.
Opening up Command Prompt and make it say the date and time. Then when Windows XP
was out, I would play around with the themes and such. I was fascinated by it. To
be honest, it wasn’t just computers that fascinated me, just machines in general
did.<br/>
<br/>
That fire of interest in machines never died out. And to this day the fire is growing.
As I grew to an age where hobbies were our world, I played with R/C cars. And when
they broke, I used to open it up and try to fix it. Failed most of the time, as
I would never understood how the circuits worked, but I learned. So making a game
is the perfect thing for me!<br/>
<br/>
When internet came along, I couldn’t handle the amount of things I could do! First,
I obviously had to learn about video games, and that’s where another fire in my
heart started, this time for video games. I learned how to act on the internet,
tips and tricks that made everyone blow their minds, and most importantly, how to
code websites! Then, in school, we were introduced to the world of programming with
Java, and that's how I got into this.<br/>
<br/>
I gathered some friends who were also interested in setting up a server. We learned
that it is not very easy to maintain such a small company. But that also taught
me the importance of keeping a group alive and functional, and that's what I will
do in this group! I shall be their personal psychiatrist.</p>

              <p>Unlike my teammates, I was not deeply interested in how computers worked nor what
they were made of until last year, when I decided I wanted to join EPITA. I began
to get an interest in coding when I was in middle school, mainly working on Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as a hobby. I may be a very
beginner at programming, only knowing what we were taught in the first semester,
but my curiosity and thirst for knowledge make up for any parts I am lacking of.
Making a game is something definitely new and interesting for any person that plays
at least a bit, or is interested in games or codes. It also has a very educational
aspect for computer engineering students as we have to learn how to manage a project,
how to make it and how to work in a team. So I am hoping I will be able to grow
and mature as a team member and as a computer engineering student along with my
team in this project.</p>

          <p class="news">Hey people!<br/><br/>
          Team CinnyRolls is finally back with a brand new website! This new website
          was made using Bootstrap which is, as they describe themselves, "a sleek,
          intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and
          easier web development."<br/>
          We decided to redo the first version as it had a lot of visual flaws that
          made our main developer cringe. But the idea behind stays the same: a
          simple but good looking, easy to use and dynamic website. We hope that
          you will appreciate the new website and the new content we will bring
          you soon...</p>

          <h5>What is our project?</h5>
          <p>The basic storyline of our game is set in a far, far future in which space traveling
has been made possible and standardized. Humans discovered a new abundant resource
that began to be widely used, mainly for fueling spacecrafts. In such an era, new
laws exist to regulate space traveling, thus making new criminals appear: they are
space pirates.<br/>
<br/>
Our heroine is an earthling young woman of age twenty-something, named Hayden, who
has been an orphan since childhood. She became a space pirate after she was taken
in and raised by one, and she has been traveling from planets to planets since then.
She mainly attacks space cargo-ships that transport sweets and candies to take and
redistribute them to orphans on every planet she stops. Her other goal is to taste
every sweet and candy of the universe, which is her main motive for her actions.<br/>
<br/>
We will follow her through her adventure on the ships she encounters and then on
the planets she lands on.</p>
